A repository for a final group project in CSCI 340 at CofC, Fall 2017.  This repository contains a text-based adventure game called "Dread Thread Adventurer."

To run! Simply run the public main method from the Main.java file. Output prompts will explain next steps.

This is a text based adventure game in which you fight a fearsome Hydra! Difficulty settings dictate how many heads the beast begins with!

Attack the hydra by typing out the head number you want to attack. Killing heads charges an Ultimate attack! Killing a head with your sword spawns two new heads, but using your ultimate attack kills 10 heads that do not spawn new ones. Use this to devastate the Hydra!

Example snippet from output:

You may attack: 0 1 2 3 4 with your sword!

Which head to attack?
 0
 
Head 0 has 5 health!
